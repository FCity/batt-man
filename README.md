# BattMan - The Battery Manager

## What is it?

It is a purely frontend app that you will help you keep track of your batteries' expiration dates across devices and rooms.

There is no backend to it -- no servers or databases. Instead, it makes use of your browser's localStorage. All app data gets stored there, making it a simple and convenient tool to use and maintain.

## How it works

The app includes forms to add and update devices, as well as a lookup table that describes all devices stored on the app. You can also delete devices or simply remove a battery from a device's record with the 'Pop' feature on the devices table.

## Why I made it

The main reason for making the app was to practice using React.js and to build a full-fledged app that had utility.
I tried to think of something that I could use and that I would use.
I definitely learned a lot in the process and hope that this app is as useful as it is silly.
